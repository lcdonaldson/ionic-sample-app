    <p class="home-intro"> Hey everyone. I thought I would try my hand
      at Ionic. It seems to be a big ticket item among Front End Devs
      Right now so let's see what we can make.
      This will just be a simple leaderboard app
      for a generic sport and team. No specifics really
      just wanting to see how the app works and displays
      on a phone.
      <br>
      <br>
      Im particularly interested in seeing some native functionality
      on my own phone, and what the differences are between iphone,
      samsung and others before deployment.
      <br>
      <br>
      Finally, I think it will be cool to complete this app and then do a duplicate using
      Ionic 4 and Vue.js
